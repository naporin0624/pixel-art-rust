# Release Command

Create a new GitHub release for the pixel-art-rust project with compiled binaries and comprehensive release notes.

## Usage
`/project:release <version> [release_notes]`

Examples:
- `/project:release v0.1.0`
- `/project:release v0.2.0 "Added new color matching algorithm"`
- `/project:release v1.0.0 "First stable release with performance improvements"`

## Parameters
1. **version**: Version tag (format: "vX.Y.Z")
2. **(optional) release_notes**: Additional release notes (auto-generated if not provided)

## Task
This command will:

1. **Pre-release checks**:
   - Verify working directory is clean
   - Check that release binaries exist
   - Validate version format
   - Update Cargo.toml version if needed

2. **Build release binaries** (if not current):
   - `cargo build --release` for Linux binary
   - Cross-compile for Windows if tools available
   - Verify binary integrity

3. **Create git tag**:
   - Create annotated tag with version
   - Push tag to remote repository

4. **Create GitHub release**:
   - Generate comprehensive release notes including:
     - New features and improvements
     - Performance optimizations
     - Bug fixes
     - Breaking changes (if any)
     - Installation instructions
   - Upload binary assets:
     - `pixel-art-rust` (Linux/macOS binary)
     - `pixel-art-rust.exe` (Windows binary)
   - Mark as latest release

5. **Generate release notes template**:
   ```markdown
